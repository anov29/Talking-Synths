Talking-Synths is a collection of FM synths that all randomly play different presets. There are 3 synths with 7 presets each.\
Each preset has a different carrier frequency, harmonicity ratio, and modulation index. Over the course of the preset's duration,
the modulation index and amplitude change. 

There is also a fourth synth that plays sine waves at random frequencies.  

All 4 synths have a unique volume path and pan modulation.
